The software was compiled and downloaded onto the controller using the
Arduino IDE. A 5v CP2102 USB to serial adapter was connected to the 
controller.

To upload hold the arduino pro mini's reset button, click the Arduino
IDE's upload button. When the compile stops release the reset button.

If the upload fails try reversing the RX and TX pins.
